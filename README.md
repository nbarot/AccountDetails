A very basic spring boot application with two api end points to retrive customer accounts and account transactions.

Please refer the import.sql under AccountDetails/src/main/resources to understand the data.

# Accounts List

http://localhost:8080/accounts/789

# Transactions List

http://localhost:8080/transactions/123

//TODO
# Unit test
Unit tests must be added but as this is a time boud test, i assume working functionality is more important here.
